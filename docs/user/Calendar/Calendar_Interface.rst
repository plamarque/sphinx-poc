Calendar interface
==================

The Calendar interface has 5 basic components.

In which:

-  |image0|: The **Toolbar** contains most of actions in Calendar, such
   as adding an event, switching between view modes and more.

-  |image1|: The **Search Pane** where you can perform quick and
   advanced searches.

-  |image2|: The **Mini calendar** where you can go backward/forward
   months by clicking |image3|/ |image4|. Also, you can jump to your
   desired date by directly clicking that date.

-  |image5|: The **Calendar View pane** where you can create events
   quickly and view your own events.

-  |image6|: The **Calendars pane** which includes 3 groups:

   -  Personal Calendars: Your private calendars.

   -  Group Calendars: Calendars of groups in which you are a member.

   -  Shared Calendars: Calendars which others share with you.

       **Note**

       If the `Task Management
       application <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithTasks>`__ is installed by
       your administrator, you will see another Calendar group named
       "*Task Calendars*\ " below your *Group Calendars*. Each project
       from this application will have an individual calendar here but
       for view purpose only. Under the group, there will be also a
       *Tasks* calendar that displays all tasks assigned to you.
