creating a new forum.

**Configuring the moderation settings**

When creating a forum, you can set moderation-related options.

Select the Moderation Options tab in the Forum form.

Do actions in the relevant fields.

**Setting forum permissions**

While creating a new forum, you can assign the **moderator** role or
rights to start topics, add and view posts in the forum to specific
users/roles/groups. To do this, select the Permissions tab in the Forum
form and follow `this
step <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Administrator.ManagingCategories.AddingCategories.SettingCategoryPermission>`__.

    **Note**

    -  When granting the "moderator" role to a specific user/role/group,
       to allow other users to start topics, add/view posts, you should
       uncheck these rights. The moderator of a forum only has right to
       manage the forum.

    -  If you do not set the starting topics, posting, and viewing posts
       permissions for any users/roles/groups, and the category which
       includes the forum is not `set
       permissions <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Administrator.ManagingCategories.AddingCategories.SettingCategoryPermission>`__,
       it means all users can do these actions.

    -  When granting any permissions above (moderate, start topics, post
       or only view posts in a forum), if you set the \* membership for
       the selected group, this permission will be granted to all users
       of that group, regardless of their membership role.

**Deleting a forum**

Only administrators can perform this action. When a forum is removed,
all of its topics will then be deleted.

Go into the forum you want to remove.

Click |image5| on the Action bar, then select Delete from the drop-down
menu.

Click **OK** in the confirmation message to accept your deletion.

**Moving a forum**

You can move a forum to another category as follows:

Go into the forum you want to move.

Click |image6| on the Action bar, then select Move from the drop-down
menu.

A list of existing categories will appear. Select a destination category
to which your selected forum will be moved.
