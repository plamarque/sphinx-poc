Subscribing to RSS feeds
========================

This function is for all users to subscribe to a specific category,
forum, topic. If there are any changes, the feed of the subscribed
category, forum or topic will be updated. To get the RSS feed, click
|image0| on the Action bar.

Or right-click the item you want to subscribe to and click RSS from the
drop-down menu.

Depending on which browser you are using, the next step may be
different. The browser used in this example is Firefox 19, which use the
