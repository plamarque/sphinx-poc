Adding a new page
-----------------

Before diving into how to add a new page, you need to clarify the
relationship between navigation node and page. Node and page are two
entities that are totally different and a node can be referenced to a
page. A page can only be accessed by users via a node.

**Using Page Creation Wizard**

The **Page Creation Wizard** is available to the portal's administrators
and facilitates them to create and publish portal pages quickly and
easily. In this way, you are creating a navigation node and its page
together.

The whole process to create a new page can be divided into **3**
specific steps:

**Step 1: Selecting a navigation node and creating the page**

In the first step, you have to set Node Name and Display Name of your
page. You are also able to decide the pages visibility and the
publication period of the page.

Open the site to which you want to add a new page. You will be switched
to your selected site only after a few seconds.

Click |image0| on the top navigation bar, then select Page Add Page from
the drop-down menu to open the Page Creation Wizard form.

The wizard is divided into two sections.

-  The left panel contains existing pages/nodes displayed in the tree
   hierarchy. Here, you can navigate up and down the node/page
   structure.

-  The right panel displays Page Editor where you can make changes on
   the selected navigation node. You can input parameters for your new
   page in this panel.

**In which:**

+==========================+==================================================+
| Selected Page Node       | The path of the selected node to add a new       |
|                          | sub-page.                                        |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Node Name                | The node name of the added page. This field is   |
|                          | required, unique and must start with a letter.   |
|                          | Only alphabetical, numerical, dash and           |
|                          | underscore characters are allowed for this field |
|                          | with the length between 3 and 30 characters.     |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Extended label mode      | Ticks the checkbox to show the Language field    |
|                          | for you to select another language for your      |
|                          | created node's display name. It means that if    |
|                          | this checkbox is deselected, the Language field  |
|                          | will be deactivated.                             |

| Language                 | Selects your desired language for the node's     |
|                          | display name from the drop-down menu.            |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Display Name             | The display name of the node which contains the  |
|                          | added page and its length must be between 3 and  |
|                          | 120 characters.                                  |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Visible                  | Toggles the global visibility of this page.      |
|                          |                                                  |
|                          | If this option is checked, the page or the page  |
|                          | node appears on the navigation bar, the page     |
|                          | navigation and the sitemap. If "Visible" is      |
|                          | checked, the visibility also depends on the      |
|                          | Publication Date & Time option.                  |
|                          |                                                  |
|                          | If not being unchecked, the page is hidden under |
|                          | any circumstances, even if the publication       |
|                          | period is valid.                                 |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Publication date & time  | Allows the page to be published for a given      |
|                          | period. If this option is checked, Start         |
|                          | Publication Date and End Publication Date will   |
|                          | be shown.                                        |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Start Publication Date   | The start date and time to publish the page.     |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| End Publication Date     | The end date and time to publish the page.       |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

    **Note**

    If a node is not visible (the "Visible" option is unchecked or the
    current time is not within publication period), it does not appear
    in any navigation or site map, but is still accessible via its URL.

   | Applications         | This tab lists all existing categories and their    |
   |                      | portlets that you easily can drag and drop into the |
   |                      | container.                                          |

   | Containers           | This tab contains all existing containers to build  |
   |                      | your page layout. You can add a container to your   |
   |                      | page area by dragging and dropping available        |
   |                      | containers from Page Editor to the main page body.  |
   |                      |                                                     |
   |                      | -  There are various layouts available, including   |
   |                      |    Rows Layout, Columns Layout, Autofit Columns     |
   |                      |    Layout, Tabs Layout and Mixed Layout.            |

   |                      |    containers. The parent container holds its child |
   |                      |    containers and the child containers can hold     |
   |                      |    applications. You can also drag a container to   |
   |                      |    another one that helps you create various        |

   |                      |    separately. Deleting the parent container means  |
   |                      |    that its child containers are removed as well.   |
   |                      |                                                     |

Define the page layout in the Page Layout tab.

Define permissions in the Permissions tab. This tab consists of four
sub-tabs named Access, Edit, Move Apps and Move Containers.

-  The Access tab shows all users who can access the page:

   -  If the value of the Owner Type field is "*Portal*\ ", the name of
      the current portal is automatically selected for the Owner Id
      field, so that the *Access* permission is assigned to all users
      who can access the current portal.

   -  If the value of the Owner Type field is "*Group*\ ", the *Access*
      permission is assigned to all users who are the members of the
      group that is selected in the Owner Id field of the Page Settings
      tab.

   To reassign the *Access* permission for the page, see details in the
   `Access
   permission <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions.AccessPermission>`__
   section.

-  The Edit shows all users who have the *Edit* permission on the page.

   -  If the value of the Owner Type field is "*Portal*\ ", the *Edit*
      permission is assigned to users who can edit the current portal.

   -  If the value of the Owner Type field is "*Group*\ ", the *Edit*
      permission is assigned to all users who are the members of the
      group that is selected in the Owner Id field of the Page Settings
      tab.

   To reassign the *Edit* permission for the page, see details in the
   `Edit
   Permission <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions.EditPermission>`__
