Watching
========

This function is for all logged-in users to keep track of changes in
categories, forums or topics via email notifications. Whenever there are
new changes, such as new categories, topics, posts created, you will
receive a notification.

**Watching a desired object**

Go into the object (category, forum or topic), then click |image0| on
the Action bar;

Or, right-click the object title and select Watch from the drop-down
menu.

The watched objects are also listed in the My Subscriptions tab in the
Settings form. When being unwatched, they will automatically be removed
from this list.

You will receive the notification message of the successful watching.
You will receive the email notifications about new posts/replies of the
forum that you are watching as well. In the email notification, you will
be provided links that help you go directly to the topic or go to reply
to the post. After clicking this link, the new posts in your watched
topic will be highlighted.

    **Note**

    Once a category/forum or a topic has already been watched, the
    Unwatch option will appear in the right-click menu or on the Action
    bar, so you can unsubscribe from the object.
