Managing categories
===================

Only administrators can do categories-related management tasks. To
manage forums better, the administrators usually build a good forum
structure using categories. So, a category is a set of forums containing
all discussions about the same subject. See the following diagram to
learn about the typical structure of a forum.

Adding a new category
---------------------

Only when you are assigned as an **administrator**, you can do this
function. Normally, one category is created as public and it allows
everyone to access without any restrictions. Meanwhile, one `restricted
category <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Administrator.ManagingCategories.AddingCategories.AddingRestrictedCategories>`__
only allows specific users/groups/memberships to access. Also, you can
assign moderators to your category and specify a set of permissions for
members in the category.

Click |image0| on the Forums Administration bar. The Category form will
be displayed.

Enter the category title into the Title field which is required. Its
length must be between 1 and 100 characters (Special characters and
spaces are accepted).

In the Category tab, optionally you can also:

-  Enter the order of category in the numeric format into the Order
   field.

-  Give a brief description for your category into the Description
   field.

-  Create a category restricted which allows specific users/roles/groups
   only to have access via one of the following ways:

   -  **The first way**

      Enter names of users/groups/memberships into the Restricted
      Audience textbox. The different values are separated by commas.

   -  **The second way**

      Use selectors next to the Restricted Audience textbox.

      **Selecting a specific user**: Click |image1| to open the Select
      User form, then check your desired users and click Add to accept
      your selection.

      **Selecting all users with a specific role in a group**:

      **i.** Click |image2| to open the Select Role form.

      **ii.** Select a group on the left panel and a specific role on
      the right panel.

          **Note**

          If you select \* on the right panel, it means that all members
          of the group are selected.

      **Selecting a group of users**:

      **i.** Click |image3| to open the Select Group form.

      **ii.** Select a group on the left panel and its sub-group on the
      right panel.

      If the group on the left panel does not have any sub-groups and
      you want to select it, click the Select this Group link.

       **Note**

       The Restricted Audience field is empty, it means any users can
       access the category.

Optionally, set category permissions.

By default, all users have rights to start topics, add and view posts in
forums of a category. However, you can set these permissions and assign
the **moderator** role to specific users/roles/groups.

-  Select the Permissions tab.

   |image4|

-  Do the same as setting the "`Restricted
   audiences <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Administrator.ManagingCategories.AddingCategories.AddingRestrictedCategories>`__\ "
   of a category.

-  Click Add to add selected users/roles/groups to the permissions list.

-  Tick the checkboxes corresponding to the rights you want to grant to
   the users/roles/groups.

To remove permissions of the users/roles/groups from the list, click the
corresponding |image5| icon.

    **Note**

    -  When granting the **moderator** to a specific user/role/group, to
       allow other users to start topics, add/view posts, you should
       uncheck these rights of the moderator. The moderator of a
       category can manage all forums in the category.

    -  When granting any permissions above, if you set the \* membership
       for the selected group, this permission will be granted to all
       users of that group, regardless of their membership role.

Click Save to finish.

    **Note**

    In PRODUCT, each space forum belongs to a category named "spaces"
    and there is only one forum per space. You cannot therefore create
    new categories within each space forum.

Editing a category
------------------

Select a category to edit from the **Forums** homepage, then click
|image6| on the Action bar when you are in the categories list.

Click Edit from the drop-down menu.

Make changes on the category properties.

Click Save to save your changes.

Deleting a category
-------------------

Select a category that you want to delete from the **Forums** homepage,
then click |image7| on the Action bar.

Click Delete from the drop-down menu.

Click **OK** in the confirmation message to accept your deletion.

    **Note**

    When a category is removed, all its forums are also removed.
