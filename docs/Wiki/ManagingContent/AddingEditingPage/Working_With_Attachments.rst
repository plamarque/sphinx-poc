Working with attachments
========================

Attachments are any files enclosed with your pages. They may be images,
documents, presentation or multimedia files.

**Viewing all attachments of a page**

The attachments are displayed at the bottom of a wiki page.

Here, you can:

-  View or download an attachment by simply clicking the attachment
   name.

-  Delete an attachment by simply clicking |image0|.

**Adding an attachment to a page**

There are two ways to add an attachment to a page:

**The first way**

In this way, you need to scroll down the page to find the Attachment
panel at the bottom. In case you do not see the Attachment panel, click
|image1| at the page header first.

Click Upload New File to open the upload window.

Select a file from your local device, then click Open. The file will
then be auto-uploaded.

**The second way**

You can use this method when editing the page content with **WYSIWYG**
editor (Rich Text editor). This way will create a link for the uploaded
file.

Select a page to which you want to add an attachment.

Select Edit at the Page Control area. For more details, see the `Editing
a
page <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithWikis.ManagingContent.AddingAndEditingPages.EditingPage>`__
section.

Select the **Rich Text** editor on the page toolbar.

Click |image3| on the toolbar of the **Rich Text** editor, then select
Attached File... from the drop-down menu.

The Link form is displayed as below.

Select a file to upload. Now you can upload a new file or select one
file from existing files.

-  **Uploading a new file:**

**i.** Double-click Upload new file/Upload file..., or click Upload new
file/Upload file... Select in the Current page or All pages tab
respectively.

**ii.** Browse a file from your local device to upload, then select
Create Link.

Optionally, you can provide the link label and tooltip by clicking Link
Settings before clicking Create Link,

-  **Selecting from existing files:** Double-click your desired file, or
   click the file and select Select.

   The form to edit the link parameters appears.
