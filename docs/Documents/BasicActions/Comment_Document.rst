-  Edit your comment by clicking |image2| or delete it by clicking
   |image3|.

    **Note**

    A formatting toolbar appears once you click in the comment composer.
    It allows you to change the formatting of your message, attaching
    images and links and preview how it will look once posted. (like
    what we have for `the activity stream
    composer <#PLFUserGuide.GettingStarted.ActivitiesInActivityStream.UpdatingStatus>`__)

    **Note**

    -  You can mention people in your comment by first typing "@" symbol
       then selecting the person name you want to mention. See
       `Mentioning
       someone <#PLFUserGuide.GettingStarted.ActivitiesInActivityStream.MentioningSomeone>`__
       for more details.

    -  Document comments are displayed exactly like in the activity
       stream.
