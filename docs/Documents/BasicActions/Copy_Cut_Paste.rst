Copying/Cutting & Pasting
=========================

These functions are used to make a content copy (including its children
and references) to other places.

There are 2 ways to cut/copy & paste content:

**The first way**

Select |image0| or |image1| from the Right-click menu or on the Action
bar.

Select the destination where the copied/cut content is stored, then
select |image2| from the Right-click menu or on the Action bar.

    **Note**

    The Paste function is enabled only after the Copy/Cut action is
    selected.

The copied/cut content (and its children) will be pasted into the new
selected path.

**The second way**

    **Note**

    To do this way, you have to enable the **Show Sidebar** checkbox.

Select |image3| or |image4| from the Right-click menu or on the Action
bar.

Select the destination that you want to be the parent of the content
which is copied/cut.

Select |image5| on the Filter bar to open the Clipboard window.

Click |image6| in the Clipboard window to paste the copied/cut content
into the selected destination.

-  You can click |image7| to delete the specific content from Clipboard.

-  You can also click the Clear All link to delete all from the list.

    **Note**

    -  You only can take the Copy action if you have this right on the
       source content.

    -  You only can take the Paste action if you have the right on the
       destination.

    -  If the destination has the same name with the copied content,
       after being pasted, an index will be added to the name of the
       pasted destination, for example *Live* and *Live[2]*.

    -  You cannot copy a "content" folder into a "document" folder.

    -  After taking the Copy action, you can take the Paste action on
       the different destinations before taking another Copy action.
