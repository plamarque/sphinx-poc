Locking/Unlocking
=================

This function is to avoid changes on a specific content and actions by
others, during a specific period.

**Locking content**

Select the content, then click |image0| from the Right-click menu or on
the **Action** bar. The selected content will be locked.

    **Note**

    -  Only users with appropriate rights can lock the content.

    -  After being locked, other users can only view the content.

    -  The lock will be kept during the current session only. If the
       user who locks the content signs out, the content will be
       unlocked.

    -  Other users can copy the locked content (by using the Copy/Paste
       functions outlined above); however, the original content cannot
       be removed or altered.

    -  If no action is taken on the locked content within 30 minutes,
       the lock will be automatically removed.

**Unlocking content**

Select the content which has been locked, then click |image1| from the
Right-click menu or on the Action bar. The content will then be unlocked
and other users can take actions on it.
