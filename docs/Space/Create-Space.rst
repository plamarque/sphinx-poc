.. _About-space-visibility:

-  **Visibility**: By default, the Visibility value is set to be Visible.

	-  Visible: The space is always visible in the public spaces list.

	-  Hidden: The space is not visible in the public spaces list.

-  **Registration**: By default, the Registration value is set as
   Validation.

   -  Open: The users sending their requests can join the space without
      any validation.

   -  Validation: The membership must be validated by the space manager.

   -  Close: The user cannot request for joining, but only the space
      manager can invite him.

4. In the **Invite users from group** tab, select all members of a specific
group for your space where you are already 'manager'.

One of the two following cases occurs when you select this tab.

-  **The first instance**: You have been already the manager of a group. It means that you have created at least a space.

   -  **i.** Tick the **Select a group of people** to invite in your space checkbox to open the form below.

   -  **ii.** Select the group in the left pane, then its child group in
      the right pane.

      You will see your selected group as below.

      |image3|

.. note:: To remove the selected groups, untick the **Select a group of people to invite in your space** checkbox.

   After you have selected one existing group, all users in that group will be invited to join your newly created space.

-  **The second instance**: You have not been a manager of any group yet. It means that this is the first time you create a space, so you cannot select a target group.

Others
------

   When a new space is created:

   -  A forum with the same name as this space is also created in the
      **Forums** application of the portal. In case this forum is
      removed from the Forums application, all members of the space
      cannot see the space's forum anymore when clicking Forums on the
      navigation bar of space.

   -  A group calendar with the same name as the space is also created
      under the Group Calendars in the Calendar application of the
      portal.

   -  An activity is created on the Activity Stream and a comment is
      added to the activity and informs that you have just joined the
      space. In case you or other space members left the space, the
      number of the space members will be updated to the activity.

.. note:: When more than two space characters are input between words in the space name, these spaces will be converted to ONLY ONE space when
			being displayed. With space characters at the beginning and end of space names, these space characters will be also omitted.
			After being created, your space will be automatically added to the list of MY SPACES on the left panel. Therefore, you can access your space by clicking its name.
