| Field              | Description                                            |
+====================+========================================================+
| Keep session alive | Keeps the working session for a long time to avoid the |
|                    | time-out. There are 3 options:                         |
|                    | Never: The session will time out if the logged-in user |
|                    | does not do any action after a given period. In this   |
|                    | case, there will be a message which asks the user to   |
|                    | log in again.                                          |
|                    |                                                        |
|                    | On Demand: The session will time out to the            |
|                    | application's requirement. If there is no request from |
|                    | the application, the session will time out after the   |
|                    | given period that is similar to that of **Never.**     |
|                    |                                                        |
|                    | Always: The session will never time out even if the    |
|                    | logged-in user does not do any action after a long     |
|                    | time.                                                  |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Show info bar by   | Ticks the checkbox to show the info bar of the portlet |
| default            | by default when the portlet is used in a page of the   |
|                    | site.                                                  |
|                    | The "Show info bar by default" option only takes       |
|                    | effect on new portlets as from the time you select the |
|                    | checkbox rather than all portlets of the site. In      |
|                    | particular, after creating your new site with the      |
|                    | "Show info bar by default" option checked, newly       |
|                    | created portlets of the site will be displayed with    |
|                    | the info bar by default. However, if you deselect this |
|                    | option when editing the site's configuration, the      |
|                    | former portlets with the shown info bar are remained;  |
|                    | meanwhile new portlets, which are created after this   |
|                    | option is deselected, will be shown without the info   |
|                    | bar.                                                   |
