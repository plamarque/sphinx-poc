Managing permissions
====================

Permissions play an important role in accessing and performing actions
in PRODUCT. Depending on the permissions assigned by administrators,
users can gain the Access and/or Edit permissions to sites, pages and
various components of the sites.

In PRODUCT, **permission types** define what a user can do within a
site, including:

-  **Access permission** enables users to access sites, pages or
   applications and content in the site pages. This permission can be
   set for multiple member groups.

-  **Edit permission** enables users to make changes on sites, pages or
   applications and content in the site pages. This permission is set
   for only one group at one time.

-  **Move Apps permission** enables users to add, delete or move
   applications on sites and pages via drag and drop. This permission
   can be set for multiple member groups.

-  **Move Containers permission** enables users to add, delete or move
   containers on sites and pages via drag and drop. This permission can
   be set for multiple member groups.

And, **permission levels** specify where the users' permission types can
be applied in the site.

-  **Site**: The permission at the site level defines actions permitted
   on the site. Users with the access permission can view (but not edit)
   the site. Meanwhile, users with the edit permission at the site level
   can modify the site.

-  **Page**: The permission at the page level restricts users to several
   particular pages. Users are only able to see and/or edit pages they
   have been granted, depending on the permission type assigned to them.

-  **Application**: The permission at the application level defines who
   can access the application.

-  **Container**: An application, page, or site may be put into one or
   more containers. The permission at the container level restricts the
   Access permission to content inside it.

With these permission types and levels, administrators can effectively
control who can access and which actions users can perform within the
site. For this reason, you, as an administrator, need to clarify the
layered architecture of a site to grant appropriate permissions to
groups. The simplest way to understand is that:

-  A site consists of one or more pages. These pages may be put into one
   or more containers.

-  Each page normally contains content and/or application(s). These
   content and applications may be put into one or more containers.

If you want members under a group (**platform/guests**, for example) to
be accessible to one application on a site page, grant the Access
permission to that group at the following layers:

-  The application and its containers

-  The page and its container where the application is stored.

-  The page site and its containers.

In the case you only grant the Access permission to the
**platform/guests** group at the site and page layers, this group will
see the page, but not see the applications and content restricted in
that page. To be clearer, see the below example.

**Making guests accessible to the Register form of Intranet**

    **Tip**

    To make handy for checking permissions at all levels, it is
    recommended you use the root account to have the highest rights.

For the Intranet site, the Register form is already featured by the
Register application and put into the Register page (node) (by selecting
|image0| Portal Sites Edit Navigation next to **intranet**).

|image1|

By default, the Register node is already linked to the Register page and
this page already contains the Register application.

You can use the URL format to access pages existing on a site:
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/{site\_name}/{node\_name} <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/{site_name}/{node_name}>`__.
Remember that {site\_name} and {node\_name} are **case-sensitive**.

In this scenario, log out and use the URL:
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register>`__.
Now, as a guest, you will be redirected to the Login form, not Register
form. This may be because the Access permission is not granted to the
**platform/guests** group (or is not made public) at the Register
application itself or its outer layers. To make it accessible to the
**platform/guests** group, do as follows:

Log in as root, then use
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register>`__
to go to the Register page.

Check the Access permission at the Register page level by clicking
|image2| Page Edit Layout.

|image3|

-  i. At the application, the Access permission is already granted to
   the **/platform/guests** group by default.

-  ii. At the container (by selecting Containers tab in **Page
   Editor**), the Access permission is already granted to the
   **platform/guests** group. Repeat this step for each container.

       **Note**

       Setting the \* membership for a group means that all its users
       are granted permissions to view the container block, regardless
       of their membership role.

-  iii. At the page (by selecting View Page properties at the **Page
   Editor** bottom), the Access permission is already granted to the
   **platform/guests** group.

    **Note**

    Remember to click |image4| to make your changes affect, if any.

Go to
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet>`__
to be at the site level, then select |image5| Site Layout.

-  i. At the site container(s) containing the Register page, the Access
   permission is made public by default, meaning that all (including
   guests) can access at the site container.

-  ii. At the outermost layer of the Intranet site (by clicking Site's
   Config at the bottom of **Edit Inline Composer**), the Access
   permission is already assigned to the **platform/users** group only.
   This is the reason why guests cannot access the Register form. So, in
   the **Access tab**, you need to select Add PermissionPlatformGuests
   in the group pane, and **\*** in the membership pane. Alternatively,
   tick the Everyone checkbox.

    **Note**

    Remember to click |image6| to make your changes affect, if any.

Log out, then try using the
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register>`__
link. Now, as a guest, you still can view the Register form, not the
Login form.

Optionally, if you want guests to be redirected to the Register form
when they only enter
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet>`__,
simply move gradually the Register node to the top in the Navigation
Management (by right-clicking **Register** and selecting Move Up - you
need to repeat this step until the Register node is at the top).

|image7|

Log out, then use the link:
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet>`__.
Now, you will be redirected to the Register form without entering the
exact URL of the Register page.

|image8|

    **Note**

    -  In this section, some examples and screenshots use `default
       groups and
       memberships <#PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.PredefinedUserGroupMembership>`__
       that are ready-made by configuration. To create groups and
       memberships as you want, see `Managing your
       organization <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingYourOrganization>`__.

    -  Do not misunderstand that labels of predefined membership types,
       such as "manager" or "publisher", represent their permissions.
       This means, those labels do not define any permissions. If you
       create a page, you are the person who decides if a "manager" has
       access to your page or not.

Permissions in this section are divided into:

-  `Setting permissions on a
   site <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions>`__

-  `Setting permissions on a
   page <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPagePermissions>`__

-  `Setting permissions on a
   container <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingContainerPermissions>`__

-  `Access permission on a
   category <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingAccessPermissionOnCategory>`__

-  `Access permission on a
   portlet <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingAccessPermissionOnPortlet>`__

    **Note**

    If you do not specify which groups or users for the **Move
    Containers** or **Move Apps** permissions, those who are granted the
    `Edit
    permission <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions.EditPermission>`__
    will have these permissions.

Setting permissions on a page
-----------------------------

If your user account belongs to the */platform/administrators* group,

permission <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions.AccessPermission>`__
section.

**Edit permission**

    **Note**

    Only users under the page's editors group can edit it. The Access
    permission can be set for several groups but the *Edit* permission
    only can be set for one group.

To give users the *Edit* permission, you must add them to the editors
group of that page via **Permission Setting** and follow steps as stated
in the `Edit
permission <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions.EditPermission>`__
section.

    `Setting Permissions on a
    Container <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingContainerPermissions>`__),
    users who are granted the **Move Containers** permission on a page
    are able to do the followings via Edit Page Edit Layout:

    -  Add new containers from the **Page Editor** to the page layout
       via drag and drop.

    -  Move containers contained in the page layout via drag and drop.

    Users who are not granted the **Move Containers** permission on a
    page are unable to see the *Delete Container* icon on containers
    laid directly on the page layout.

    Access, Edit, Move Apps and Move Containers permissions, all users
    of the group regardless of their membership role will be granted the
    *Access, Edit, Move Apps* and *Move Containers* permissions
    respectively.

Setting permissions on a container
----------------------------------

If your user account belongs to the */platform/administrators* group,
you can set the *Access, Move Apps* and *Move Containers* permissions on
a specific container of a page (via Edit Page Edit Layout Page Editor)
or a site (via Edit Site Layout Edit Inline Composer).

Select the **Containers** tab, then hover your cursor over the container
that you want to edit and click on |image22|.

Select the **Permissions** tab.

|image23|

Click on the Add Permission button in the *Access, Move Apps* and *Move
Containers* tabs to add the corresponding permissions to specific
groups.

    **Note**

    -  Users who are not granted the *Move Apps* permission on a
       container do not see the *Delete Portlet* icon laid directly on
       applications contained in the container in edit mode.

    -  Users who are not granted the *Move Containers* permission on a
       container do not see the *Delete Container* icon in edit mode.

    -  Users who are granted the *Move Apps* or *Move Containers*
       permissions on a container can add new applications or containers
       from the composer to this container via drag and drop. Besides,
       they can move the applications or containers contained in this
       container via drag and drop.

Setting Access permission on a category

Setting the *Access* permission on categories allows these categories to
be listed when a page is edited to add portlets or widgets.

Click |image24| Applications on the top navigation bar to open the
**Manage Applications** page.

|image25|

Select one category from the list of available categories in the left
panel, then click |image26|.

Select the Permission Setting tab.

Set the *Access* permission on a category that is similar to the `Access
permission <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions.AccessPermission>`__
section.

    **Note**

    If you set the \* membership for a group, all users of the group
    will have the right to view this category when `editing
    layout <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingSites.EditingSite.EditingLayout>`__.

Setting Access permission on a portlet
--------------------------------------

`Go to the Manage Applications
page <#AccessingManageApplicationsPage>`__.

Select the category containing the portlet you want to set the *Access*
permission, then click the relevant portlet under your selected
category.

The selected portlet will be highlighted in grey in the left panel with
its detailed information in the right pane.

Follow steps stated in the `Access
permission <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions.AccessPermission>`__
section to assign the Access permission on your selected portlet in the
Default Permission Settings form.

    **Note**

    If you set the \* membership for a group, all users of the group
    will have the right to view this application when `editing
    layout <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingSites.EditingSite.EditingLayout>`__.
